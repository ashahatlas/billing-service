/**
 * Client for the Worldpay acquirer, which settles Visa and Mastercard.
 *
 * <p><strong>Credentials.</strong> The acquirer key is live and tied to the merchant account.
 * It is injected from the platform secret store as {@code ACQUIRER_API_KEY} and must never
 * appear in source or in a deploy descriptor.
 *
 * <p><strong>Irreversibility.</strong> {@link #charge} moves money. A charge can only be
 * undone by calling {@link #refund} with the acquirer reference we were given — there is no
 * way to reverse it from our side, and a reference this acquirer does not recognise cannot be
 * refunded at all. Any change that introduces a second acquirer has to keep the refund path
 * working for references issued by both, in both directions of a deploy.
